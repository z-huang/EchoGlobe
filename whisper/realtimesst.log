And then overnight, we're hearing from Trump again as he demands more information about the international students who attend writing this. Quote, we want to know who these foreign students are a reasonable request since we give Harvard billions of dollars. And he would  on to claim that Harvard isn't exactly forthcoming. Now about 27% of Harvard student body is of students from overseas and they do release some of that information starting in 2024 they do have a list.

Our team has spoken with multiple international students at Harvard who described the feeling right now as one of uncertainty and even pure panic as Trump works to ban their enrol.

The administration cut 450 million in federal grants, froze more than 2 billion in research funding, moved to ban international students, what we're talking about today, threatened to end the university's tax exempt status and is using the Department of Justice to investigate diversity initiatives. So again, a lot of uncertainty for these international students at Harvard, but also uncertainty for the faculty staff and other students as well.  Fred. All right, Julie Bembrook. Thanks so much. Or with me now to talk more about these developments is Cornell William Brooks. He is the former president and CEO of the NAACP and is currently a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School Professor, great to see you. It's good to see you as always.

Starting in 2024, they do have a list of which countries those students are attending from. It's important to note that according to Harvard's website and the student aid section, it makes very clear that foreign students are not eligible for federal funding. And can instead apply for scholarships and things like that through  college itself. Our team has spoken with multiple international students at Harvard who described the feeling right now as one of uncertainty and even pure panic as Trump works to ban their enrollment. The university also responding calling this move a clear retaliation for its refusal to meet some of the government's demands on certain policies. They're on campus and this is just the latest and a long back and forth. We're going to pull up some of those important moments in exchange  that happened over just the last several weeks now. The administration cut 450 million in federal grants, froze more than 2 billion in research funding, moved to ban international students, what we're talking about today, threatened to end the university's tax exempt status and is using the Department of Justice to investigate diversity initiatives. So again, a lot of uncertainty for these international students at Harvard, but also uncertainty for the faculty staff and other students as well.  Fred. All right, Julia Benbrook. Thanks so much.

So what do you think is at the heart of President Trump's obsession here?  That is a great word to describe it. It is an obsession because what we have seen over many weeks, many months, is an ever-shifting exercise in arguments and excuses for going out to Harvard.  for no serious legal basis. Meaning we have a federal judge who's issued a temporary restraining order against this ban against.

2025-05-27 21:43:19.166 - RealTimeSTT: realtimestt - DEBUG - Realtime text detected:  President Trump is escalating his attacks on Harvard University. Just days after a federal judge temporarily halted his administration's ban on Harvard and ruling international students, the president is now demanding  quote names and countries of the thousands of international students at the Ivy League School. Trump suggesting that foreign countries, some of which he says are hostile to the U.S. should contribute funding to educate their students. For more on this escalating fuel, let's go to Julia Benbrook at near Trump's duty as state where he's spending the weekend. Julia tells more about the President's sentiment here.  Well, there is escalation in President Donald Trump's ongoing battle with Harvard University. Just a couple of days ago, he was working to ban international students from attending Harvard, a move that was swiftly halted by a federal judge. And then overnight, we're hearing from Trump again as he demands more information about the international students who attend writing this. Quote, we want to know who these foreign students are a reasonable request since we give Harvard billions of dollars.  on to claim that Harvard isn't exactly forthcoming.

It is an obsession because what we have seen over many weeks, many months, is an ever-shifting exercise in arguments and excuses for going out to Harvard.  for no serious legal basis. Meaning we have a federal judge who's issued a temporary restraining order against this ban against nearly...  6,000, nearly 7,000 international students, one out of every four at Harvard, six out of every 10 at the Kennedy School where I teach. And what we have seen is over and over again, the Trump administration using its lawyers to go after Harvard's fiscal budget by literally taking away almost three.  Bill him dollars after they admitted that they made a mistake. I mean, that's absolutely... And after that's just in the research kind of funding. That's right. That's right.

2025-05-27 21:45:38.145 - RealTimeSTT: realtimestt - DEBUG - Realtime text detected:  President Trump is escalating his attacks on Harvard University. Just days after a federal judge temporarily halted his administration's ban on Harvard and ruling international students, the president is now demanding  quote names and countries of the thousands of international students at the Ivy League School. Trump suggesting that foreign countries, some of which he says are hostile to the U.S. should contribute funding to educate their students. For more on this escalating fuel, let's go to Julia Benbrook at near Trump's duty as state where he's spending the weekend. Julia tells more about the President's sentiment here.  Well, there is escalation in President Donald Trump's ongoing battle with Harvard University. Just a couple of days ago, he was working to ban international students from attending Harvard, a move that was swiftly halted by a federal judge. And then overnight, we're hearing from Trump again as he demands more information about the international students who attend writing this. Quote, we want to know who these foreign students are a reasonable request since we give Harvard billions of dollars.  on to claim that Harvard isn't exactly forthcoming. Now, about 27% of Harvard's student body is of students from overseas, and they do release some of that information. Starting in 2024, they do have a list of which countries those students are attending from. It's important to note that according to Harvard's website and the student aid section, it makes very clear that foreign students are not eligible for federal funding. And can instead apply for scholarships and things like that through  college itself. Our team has spoken with multiple international students at Harvard who described the feeling right now as one of uncertainty and even pure panic as Trump works to ban their enrollment. The university also responding calling this move a clear retaliation for its refusal to meet some of the government's demands on certain policies. They're on campus and this is just the latest and a long back and forth. We're going to pull up some of those important moments in exchange for  that happened over just the last several weeks now. The administration cut 450 million in federal grants, froze more than 2 billion in research funding, moved to ban international students, what we're talking about today, threatened to end the university's tax exempt status and is using the Department of Justice to investigate diversity initiatives. So again, a lot of uncertainty for these international students at Harvard, but also uncertainty for the faculty staff and other students as well.  Fred. All right, Julia Benbrook. Thanks so much. Or with me now to talk more about these developments is Cornell William Brooks. He is the former president and CEO of the NAACP and is currently a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School Professor, great to see you. It's good to see you as always. So what do you think is at the heart of President Trump's obsession here? That is a great word to describe it.

Just days after a federal judge temporarily halted his administration's ban on Harvard and ruling international students, the president is now demanding  quote names and countries of the thousands of international students at the Ivy League School. Trump suggesting that foreign countries, some of which he says are hostile to the U.S. should contribute funding to educate their students. For more on this escalating fuel, let's go to Julia Benbrook at near Trump's duty as state where he's spending the weekend. Julia tells more about the President's sentiment here.  Well, there is escalation in President Donald Trump's ongoing battle with Harvard University. Just a couple of days ago, he was working to ban international students from attending Harvard, a move that was swiftly halted by a federal judge. And then overnight, we're hearing from Trump again as he demands more information about the international students who attend writing this. Quote, we want to know who these foreign students are a reasonable request since we give Harvard billions of dollars.  on to claim that Harvard isn't exactly forthcoming. Now, about 27% of Harvard's student body is of students from overseas, and they do release some of that information. Starting in 2024, they do have a list of which countries those students are attending from. It's important to note that according to Harvard's website and the student aid section, it makes very clear that foreign students are not eligible for federal funding. And can instead apply for scholarships and things like that through  college itself. Our team has spoken with multiple international students at Harvard who described the feeling right now as one of uncertainty and even pure panic as Trump works to ban their enrollment. The university also responding calling this move a clear retaliation for its refusal to meet some of the government's demands on certain policies. They're on campus and this is just the latest and a long back and forth. We're going to pull up some of those important moments in exchange for  changes that happened over just the last several weeks now. The administration cut 450 million in federal grants, froze more than 2 billion in research funding.

Well, there is escalation in President Donald Trump's ongoing battle with Harvard University. Just a couple of days ago, he was working to ban international students from attending Harvard, a move that was swiftly halted by a federal judge. And then overnight, we're hearing from Trump again as he demands more information about the international students who attend writing this. Quote, we want to know who these foreign students are a reasonable request since we give Harvard billions of dollars.  on to claim that Harvard isn't exactly forthcoming. Now, about 27% of Harvard's student body is of students from overseas, and they do release some of that information. Starting in 2024, they do have a list of which countries those students are attending from. It's important to note that according to Harvard's website and the student aid section, it makes very clear that foreign students are not eligible for federal funding. And can instead apply for scholarships and things like that through  college itself. Our team has spoken with multiple international students at Harvard who described the feeling right now as one of uncertainty and even pure panic as Trump works to ban their enrollment. The university also responding, calling this move a clear retaliation for its refusal to meet some of the government's demands on certain policies.

He is the former president and CEO of the NAACP and is currently a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Professor Great to see you. It's good to see you as always. So what do you think is at the heart of President Trump's obsession here?  That is a great word to describe it. It is an obsession because what we have seen over many weeks, many months, is an ever-shifting exercise in arguments and excuses for going out to Harvard.

Just days after a federal judge temporarily halted his administration's ban on Harvard and ruling international students, the president is now demanding  quote names and countries of the thousands of international students at the Ivy League School. Trump suggesting that foreign countries, some of which he says are hostile to the U.S. should contribute funding to educate their students. For more on this escalating fuel, let's go to Julia Benbrook at near Trump's duty as state where he's spending the weekend. Julia tells more about the President's sentiment here.  Well, there is escalation in President Donald Trump's ongoing battle with Harvard University. Just a couple of days ago, he was working to ban international students from attending Harvard, a move that was swiftly halted by a federal judge. And then overnight, we're hearing from Trump again as he demands more information about the international students who attend writing this. Quote, we want to know who these foreign students are a reasonable request since we give Harvard billions of dollars.  on to claim that Harvard isn't exactly forthcoming. Now, about 27% of Harvard's student body is of students from overseas, and they do release some of that information. Starting in 2024, they do have a list of which countries those students are attending from. It's important to note that according to Harvard's website and the student aid section, it makes very clear that foreign students are not eligible for federal funding. And can instead apply for scholarships and things like that through  college itself. Our team has spoken with multiple international students at Harvard who described the feeling right now as one of uncertainty and even pure panic as Trump works to ban their enrollment. The university also responding calling this move a clear retaliation for its refusal to meet some of the government's demands on certain policies. They're on campus and this is just the latest and a long back and forth. We're going to pull up some of those important moments in exchange  that happened over just the last several weeks now. The administration cut 450 million in federal grants, froze more than 2 billion in research funding, moved to ban international students, what we're talking about today, threatened to end the university's tax exempt status and is using the Department of Justice to investigate diversity initiatives. So again, a lot of uncertainty for these international students at Harvard, but also uncertainty for the faculty staff and other students as well.  Fred. All right, Julia Benbrook. Thanks so much.

2025-05-27 21:53:38.028 - RealTimeSTT: realtimestt - DEBUG - Realtime text detected:  President Trump is escalating his attacks on Harvard University. Just days after a federal judge temporarily halted his administration's ban on Harvard and ruling international students, the president is now demanding  quote names and countries of the thousands of international students at the Ivy League School. Trump suggesting that foreign countries, some of which he says are hostile to the U.S. should contribute funding to educate their students. For more on this escalating fuel, let's go to Julia Benbrook at near Trump's duty as state where he's spending the weekend. Julia tells more about the President's sentiment here.  Well, there is escalation in President Donald Trump's ongoing battle with Harvard University. Just a couple of days ago, he was working to ban international students from attending Harvard, a move that was swiftly halted by a federal judge. And then overnight, we're hearing from Trump again as he demands more information about the international students who attend writing this. Quote, we want to know who these foreign students are a reasonable request since we give Harvard billions of dollars.  on to claim that Harvard isn't exactly forthcoming. Now, about 27% of Harvard's student body is of students from overseas, and they do release some of that information. Starting in 2024, they do have a list of which countries those students are attending from. It's important to note that according to Harvard's website and the student aid section, it makes very clear that foreign students are not eligible for federal funding. And can instead apply for scholarships and things like that through  college itself. Our team has spoken with multiple international students at Harvard who described the feeling right now as one of uncertainty and even pure panic.

2025-05-27 22:01:53.104 - RealTimeSTT: realtimestt - DEBUG - Realtime text detected:  President Trump is escalating his attacks on Harvard University. Just days after a federal judge temporarily halted his administration's ban on Harvard and ruling international students, the president is now demanding  quote names and countries of the thousands of international students at the Ivy League School. Trump suggesting that foreign countries, some of which he says are hostile to the U.S. should contribute funding to educate their students. For more on this escalating fuel, let's go to Julia Benbrook at near Trump's duty as state where he's spending the weekend. Julia tells more about the President's sentiment here.  Well, there is escalation in President Donald Trump's ongoing battle with Harvard University. Just a couple of days ago, he was working to ban international students from attending Harvard, a move that was swiftly halted by a federal judge. And then overnight, we're hearing from Trump again as he demands more information about the international students who attend writing this. Quote, we want to know who these foreign students are a reasonable request since we give Harvard billions of dollars.  on to claim that Harvard isn't exactly forthcoming. Now, about 27% of Harvard's student body is of students from overseas, and they do release some of that information. Starting in 2024, they do have a list of which countries those students are attending from. It's important to note that according to Harvard's website and the student aid section, it makes very clear that foreign students are not eligible for federal funding.

The administration cut 450 million in federal grants, froze more than 2 billion in research funding, moved to ban international students, what we're talking about today, threatened to end the university's tax exempt status and is using the Department of Justice to investigate diversity initiatives. So again, a lot of uncertainty for these international students at Harvard, but also uncertainty for the faculty staff and other students as well.  All right, Julie Bembrook, thanks so much. Or with me now to talk more about these developments is Cornell William Brooks. He is the former president and CEO of the NAACP and is currently a professor at Harvard's Kennedy.
